**What is The Portable Tow Truck?**
The Portable Tow Truck is the ultimate tire traction mat/device that was originally developed out of necessity to save time and money for parcel delivery vehicles that got stuck on the road due to adverse weather and terrain conditions. 
Each set (available in Black and Orange) contains 2 traction mats (one for each spinning tire) that fit in the trunk of your vehicle. 
Made from polypropylene (which aids in both strength and flexibility) and weighting 2.5 lb. per 36-inch long mat, 1 set (5 lb.) of The Portable Tow Truck gives you 2 solid, stable, virtually indestructible traction mats that will work on almost any vehicle that is stuck in snow, sand, or mud.
Now, you have the tools and peace of mind that the largest parcel companies in the world have to avoid unnecessary towing costs and headaches.
